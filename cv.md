## About myself:

During the course, I realized for myself that back-end development in Java is closer to me than front-end development. At the moment I am continuing my self-study and trying to fill my portfolio [(My GitHub)](https://github.com/SergeyNavok), also learning the Spring framework.
At the moment, I have quite a bit of experience, but I have a desire to learn and learn something new.
Ready for any internship, but preferably outside of working hours.

1. Java (Java Core, Java 8)
